        <p class="experience__desc">
          Designer and former engineer with nearly two years of experience in UI design and 6+ years in frontend development. Working in design and engineering, at startups as well as small teams within bigger companies, has allowed me to develop a wide range of multi-disciplinary skills in diverse contexts. I work on detailed UI designs to complement the wider user journey and build design systems that drive reusability and consistency. 
        </p>
        <p class="experience__desc">
          My experience as an engineer allows me to understand the technical implications of my design decisions. I can translate design concepts into interactive prototypes to test ideas or collaborate with engineering teams to bring designs to life. Experience working on a design system as both a frontend engineer and a designer has given me a unique insight into the challenges of creating and maintaining design systems from both perspectives.
